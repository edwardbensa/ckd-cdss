None of the studies included children and young people. The committee was also concerned about the value of P30 as a measure of accuracy (P30 is the probability that the measured value is within 30% of the true value), the broad range of P30 values found across equations and the relative value or accuracy of ethnicity adjustments to eGFR equations in different ethnic groups. The committee agreed that adding an ethnicity adjustment to eGFR equations for different ethnicities may not be valid or accurate. Categorisations based on ethnicity lump together people with a diverse range of family backgrounds and differences in eGFR across ethnicities are likely to at least partly arise because of differences in average muscle mass between ethnic groups. However, muscle mass also differs from person to person within the same ethnicity and so making an adjustment based on ethnicity may be inaccurate for some people. Therefore, the committee agreed to remove the 2014 recommendation on how to adjust the CKD-EPI creatinine equation for adults of African-Caribbean or African family origin. The committee highlighted the 2008 recommendation, which states that caution should be used when interpreting eGFR and in adults with extremes of muscle mass and on those who consume protein supplements (this was added to recommendation 1.1.1). The committee made [recommendations for research on appropriate eGFR equations for black, Asian and minority ethnic groups (adults, children and young people) in the UK](recommendations-for-research#creatinine-based-estimate-of-egfr-existing-calculations). They agreed that factors other than ethnicity should also be explored as biomarkers.\n\nThe committee agreed that in the absence of good evidence for their accuracy, the 2014 recommendations that cystatin-c equations should be considered during diagnosis in certain circumstances, should be removed. In particular, they noted that although using cystatin-c equations may reduce false-positive results, it is likely to also increase false-negative results. This will avoid potentially misleading tests being conducted and the costs associated with these. They made a [recommendation for research for a large study using UK data to evaluate the accuracy of cystatin-c equations](recommendations-for-research#cystatin-c-equations).\n\n#### Impact on practice\n\nThere will be an impact on practice, as the adjustment of the CKD-EPI creatinine equation for adults of African-Caribbean or African family origin has been removed from the guideline.

The results of both the validation study and cost-effectiveness modelling undertaken for the guideline showed using this equation and threshold as a referral criteria (rather than an eGFR threshold) was likely to be both more sensitive and more specific than the criteria in the 2014 NICE guideline, meaning people who will progress to needing renal replacement therapy are identified earlier, and there are fewer unnecessary referrals to secondary care.\n\nThe benefits of this approach over using an eGFR threshold (as in the 2014 NICE guideline) were not large, but the committee agreed they were meaningful. They also agreed there were additional potential benefits of using the 4-variable Kidney Failure Risk Equation, including the ability to provide people with an individual risk assessment, which could help them to proactively manage their own risk, and inform the management plans in secondary care.\n\nHowever, validation of the risk equation was only in adults, so the committee made a separate recommendation for children and young people. Black people were under-represented in the study and, although there was a sizeable proportion of people of Asian family origin, the location of the study suggests that people of east Asian family origin were likely to be under-represented. Therefore, the committee agreed to make a [recommendation for research for validation of the risk equation](recommendations-for-research#risk-assessment-for-black-asian-and-minority-ethnic-groups).\n\nThe committee agreed that it is important to discuss with a person with CKD what risk means. They added additional recommendations on providing information about risk, using jargon-free language, allowing enough time for discussions and documenting any decisions made.\n\n#### How the recommendations might affect practice\n\nIf the 4-variable Kidney Failure Risk Equation can be built into laboratory computer systems, as part of how eGFR and ACR results are returned to GPs, there should be no difficulty in implementing the recommendations. Because the calculation requires both an eGFR and ACR value, it can only be produced if the GP requests both those measurements. These recommendations are intended to provide additional information to supplement eGFR and ACR values, rather than changing how often these values are requested by GPs.\n\nThere may be particular difficulties for laboratories that store eGFR and ACR values on separate systems that cannot automatically communicate. In this situation, calculations may have to be done manually. However, this is still likely to be a more efficient system than calculations being carried out routinely by GPs. Overall, the referral criteria are predicted to slightly reduce monitoring costs but, excluding costs associated with dialysis, overall there should be no substantial impact on resource use.\n\nThere may be an implementation period before the risk equation results are available to all GPs. Until then, some GPs may have to continue to base referral decisions on eGFR and ACR values independently, as is currently done, without providing patients with a quantitative assessment of their risk of needing renal replacement therapy. The faster these recommendations can be routinely adopted the less time it will be necessary for these 2 parallel approaches to both be in use.\n\n[Return to recommendations](recommendations#risk-assessment-referral-criteria-and-shared-care)",

Because the calculation requires both an eGFR and ACR value, it can only be produced if the GP requests both those measurements. These recommendations are intended to provide additional information to supplement eGFR and ACR values, rather than changing how often these values are requested by GPs.\n\nThere may be particular difficulties for laboratories that store eGFR and ACR values on separate systems that cannot automatically communicate. In this situation, calculations may have to be done manually. However, this is still likely to be a more efficient system than calculations being carried out routinely by GPs. Overall, the referral criteria are predicted to slightly reduce monitoring costs but, excluding costs associated with dialysis, overall there should be no substantial impact on resource use.\n\nThere may be an implementation period before the risk equation results are available to all GPs. Until then, some GPs may have to continue to base referral decisions on eGFR and ACR values independently, as is currently done, without providing patients with a quantitative assessment of their risk of needing renal replacement therapy.

For children under 2 years, the Hb range was between 95 and 115 g/litre. These were based on evidence for adults. In 2020, the committee reviewed the evidence specifically for children and young people. The only evidence for this population came from a single small low-quality study, comparing the effects of a high and low Hb target on left ventricular mass index. No difference in effect was found. Given the lack of evidence, the committee agreed that the recommendations made in 2015 should not be changed.\n\nThe 2015 guideline recommended using the same target Hb range as adults for children and young people over 2 years, and a slightly lower level in children under 2. However, children and young people have different coagulation risks than adults, and are more prone to reductions in Hb from blood loss in haemodialysis circuits.

They also highlighted that there are differences between iron preparations that affect their bioequivalence. Therefore, pharmacist advice is likely to be needed when choosing iron preparations.

The committee agreed that children and young people should be given a high dose as set out in the BNFc, although they noted that use of intravenous iron preparations in children under 14 years was off label.\n\nThe committee was aware of a [MHRA alert on intravenous iron and serious hypersensitivity reactions](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/intravenous-iron-and-serious-hypersensitivity-reactions-strengthened-recommendations#prescribing). The alert states that 'intravenous iron products should only be administered when staff trained to evaluate and manage anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions \u2013 as well as resuscitation facilities \u2013 are immediately available.' The committee agreed that intravenous iron should not be administered at home but recognised that this has a significant impact on people on home dialysis.\n\nMost of the evidence was from studies with participants on haemodialysis. The committee agreed that more research would help to inform future guidance on intravenous iron for people with stage 5 CKD who are on peritoneal dialysis.\n\n#### How the recommendations might affect practice\n\nThe recommendations are unlikely to lead to a substantial change in costs, as intravenous iron is relatively inexpensive, and there was evidence found in adults that use of high-dose iron leads to lower doses of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents being used, thereby offsetting any extra costs.\n\n[Return to recommendations](recommendations#correcting-iron-deficiency)"

However, evidence was limited for adults not on dialysis, and for children and young people. The committee agreed to extrapolate from the evidence for adults with stage 5 CKD on dialysis, so they could make recommendations for the other groups.\n\nPeople's preferences need to be taken into account when offering phosphate binders, because this could have an impact on adherence. The differences in phosphate binder formulations (for example, chewable and non-chewable) and the effect this has on how they are taken (before, with or after food) mean that people will often prefer one phosphate binder over the others. Oral phosphate binders are also unpleasant to take, and this might affect adherence as well. It is important to involve people in the choice of phosphate binder as far as possible, to ensure they are prescribed one they are happy with and can take as recommended.\n\nThe committee highlighted several factors that renal physicians assess at clinical reviews for people who are taking phosphate binders (including parathyroid hormone, vitamin D and serum calcium).\n\n##### Which phosphate binders to use for children and young people\n\nThe committee reviewed the recommendations from the 2013 guideline in the light of limited new evidence. For children and young people with high serum calcium, they agreed to recommend sevelamer carbonate instead of sevelamer hydrochloride. This is because sevelamer carbonate offers a better balance of benefits and costs. The committee highlighted that in growing children and young people, calcium is often maintained close to, but not above the upper limit of the age-related reference range. Calcium is essential for bone development in children.\n\n##### Which phosphate binders to use for adults\n\nThe committee reviewed the evidence for phosphate binders both in adults on dialysis and adults not having dialysis. Although the evidence for those not on dialysis was limited, it did reflect the evidence for adults on dialysis in every area apart from sucroferric oxyhydroxide. As there was no evidence on sucroferric oxyhydroxide in adults not on dialysis, the committee did not recommend it for this group.\n\nThe evidence showed that the most cost-effective treatment strategy is to start with calcium acetate, and switch to sevelamer carbonate if the person gets hypercalcaemia. This is because:\n\n- calcium acetate as a first-line treatment provides the best balance of benefits, harms and costs\n- calcium carbonate is cheaper than calcium acetate, but is more likely to cause high serum calcium levels and associated adverse outcomes\n- sevelamer carbonate and sevelamer hydrochloride are more expensive than calcium acetate, and do not provide enough benefit as a first-line treatment to justify the extra expense\n- when people have high serum calcium levels and cannot take calcium acetate, sevelamer carbonate is the best alternative; it is cheaper than sevelamer hydrochloride, and provides similar benefits, however, it still costs more than calcium acetate and, for first-line treatment, it does not provide enough benefit to justify this extra expense\n- sucroferric oxyhydroxide is not cost effective as a first-line treatment, but is a reasonable choice for people who cannot take calcium acetate or sevelamer carbonate\n- lanthanum carbonate is much more expensive than calcium acetate and sevelamer carbonate and may provide less benefit than other non-calcium-based phosphate binders.\n\nBased on this evidence, the committee recommended a treatment sequence and alternatives for different situations.\n\nThe committee also agreed that diet and dialysis (when appropriate) had a large impact on serum phosphate levels. Therefore, before offering phosphate binders it is important to provide dietary advice and ensure people are on the dialysis regime that works best for them.\n\nThe committee made a [recommendation for research to address the lack of evidence in adults not on dialysis](recommendations-for-research#phosphate-binders).\n\n#### How the recommendations might affect practice\n\nReplacing sevelamer hydrochloride with sevelamer carbonate may result in lower resource use, because there is a cheap generic version of sevelamer carbonate available.\n\nThere is currently variation across the UK in use of sucroferric oxyhydroxide. The recommendation on this phosphate binder may increase costs. However, this increase is unlikely to be substantial, because sucroferric oxyhydroxide is only recommended as a third-line option.\n\n[Return to recommendations](recommendations#before-starting-phosphate-binders-for-adults-children-and-young-people)",

Although the evidence for those not on dialysis was limited, it did reflect the evidence for adults on dialysis in every area apart from sucroferric oxyhydroxide. As there was no evidence on sucroferric oxyhydroxide in adults not on dialysis, the committee did not recommend it for this group.\n\nThe evidence showed that the most cost-effective treatment strategy is to start with calcium acetate, and switch to sevelamer carbonate if the person gets hypercalcaemia. This is because:\n\n- calcium acetate as a first-line treatment provides the best balance of benefits, harms and costs\n- calcium carbonate is cheaper than calcium acetate, but is more likely to cause high serum calcium levels and associated adverse outcomes\n- sevelamer carbonate and sevelamer hydrochloride are more expensive than calcium acetate, and do not provide enough benefit as a first-line treatment to justify the extra expense\n- when people have high serum calcium levels and cannot take calcium acetate, sevelamer carbonate is the best alternative; it is cheaper than sevelamer hydrochloride, and provides similar benefits, however, it still costs more than calcium acetate and, for first-line treatment, it does not provide enough benefit to justify this extra expense\n- sucroferric oxyhydroxide is not cost effective as a first-line treatment, but is a reasonable choice for people who cannot take calcium acetate or sevelamer carbonate\n- lanthanum carbonate is much more expensive than calcium acetate and sevelamer carbonate and may provide less benefit than other non-calcium-based phosphate binders.\n\nBased on this evidence, the committee recommended a treatment sequence and alternatives for different situations.\n\nThe committee also agreed that diet and dialysis (when appropriate) had a large impact on serum phosphate levels. Therefore, before offering phosphate binders it is important to provide dietary advice and ensure people are on the dialysis regime that works best for them.\n\nThe committee made a [recommendation for research to address the lack of evidence in adults not on dialysis](recommendations-for-research#phosphate-binders).\n\n#### How the recommendations might affect practice\n\nReplacing sevelamer hydrochloride with sevelamer carbonate may result in lower resource use, because there is a cheap generic version of sevelamer carbonate available.\n\nThere is currently variation across the UK in use of sucroferric oxyhydroxide. The recommendation on this phosphate binder may increase costs.

It is important to involve people in the choice of phosphate binder as far as possible, to ensure they are prescribed one they are happy with and can take as recommended.\n\nThe committee highlighted several factors that renal physicians assess at clinical reviews for people who are taking phosphate binders (including parathyroid hormone, vitamin D and serum calcium).\n\n##### Which phosphate binders to use for children and young people\n\nThe committee reviewed the recommendations from the 2013 guideline in the light of limited new evidence. For children and young people with high serum calcium, they agreed to recommend sevelamer carbonate instead of sevelamer hydrochloride. This is because sevelamer carbonate offers a better balance of benefits and costs. The committee highlighted that in growing children and young people, calcium is often maintained close to, but not above the upper limit of the age-related reference range. Calcium is essential for bone development in children.\n\n##### Which phosphate binders to use for adults\n\nThe committee reviewed the evidence for phosphate binders both in adults on dialysis and adults not having dialysis. Although the evidence for those not on dialysis was limited, it did reflect the evidence for adults on dialysis in every area apart from sucroferric oxyhydroxide. As there was no evidence on sucroferric oxyhydroxide in adults not on dialysis, the committee did not recommend it for this group.\n\nThe evidence showed that the most cost-effective treatment strategy is to start with calcium acetate, and switch to sevelamer carbonate if the person gets hypercalcaemia. This is because:\n\n- calcium acetate as a first-line treatment provides the best balance of benefits, harms and costs\n- calcium carbonate is cheaper than calcium acetate, but is more likely to cause high serum calcium levels and associated adverse outcomes\n- sevelamer carbonate and sevelamer hydrochloride are more expensive than calcium acetate, and do not provide enough benefit as a first-line treatment to justify the extra expense\n- when people have high serum calcium levels and cannot take calcium acetate, sevelamer carbonate is the best alternative; it is cheaper than sevelamer hydrochloride, and provides similar benefits, however, it still costs more than calcium acetate and, for first-line treatment, it does not provide enough benefit to justify this extra expense\n- sucroferric oxyhydroxide is not cost effective as a first-line treatment, but is a reasonable choice for people who cannot take calcium acetate or sevelamer carbonate\n- lanthanum carbonate is much more expensive than calcium acetate and sevelamer carbonate and may provide less benefit than other non-calcium-based phosphate binders.\n\nBased on this evidence, the committee recommended a treatment sequence and alternatives for different situations.\n\nThe committee also agreed that diet and dialysis (when appropriate) had a large impact on serum phosphate levels. Therefore, before offering phosphate binders it is important to provide dietary advice and ensure people are on the dialysis regime that works best for them.\n\nThe committee made a [recommendation for research to address the lack of evidence in adults not on dialysis](recommendations-for-research#phosphate-binders).\n\n#### How the recommendations might affect practice\n\nReplacing sevelamer hydrochloride with sevelamer carbonate may result in lower resource use, because there is a cheap generic version of sevelamer carbonate available.\n\nThere is currently variation across the UK in use of sucroferric oxyhydroxide. The recommendation on this phosphate binder may increase costs. However, this increase is unlikely to be substantial, because sucroferric oxyhydroxide is only recommended as a third-line option.\n\n[Return to recommendations](recommendations#before-starting-phosphate-binders-for-adults-children-and-young-people)",
