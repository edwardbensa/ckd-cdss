Query:
When should I refer a CKD patient to nephrology?

Answer:
You should refer a CKD patient to nephrology in the following situations:

1. **For adults without diabetes**: If the patient's albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) is 70 mg/mmol or more, refer for nephrology assessment and consider offering an ARB or ACE inhibitor. If the ACR is between 30 and 70 mg/mmol, monitor according to guidelines, but consider discussing with a nephrologist if there is a decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or an increase in ACR ([Recommendation 1.6.7](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#pharmacotherapy)).

2. **For children and young people**: Refer if they have any of the following:
   - An ACR of 3 mg/mmol or more (confirmed on a repeat early morning urine sample)
   - Haematuria
   - Any decrease in eGFR
   - Hypertension
   - Known or suspected rare or genetic causes of CKD
   - Suspected renal artery stenosis
   - Renal outflow obstruction ([Recommendation 1.5.6](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#risk-assessment-referral-criteria-and-shared-care)).

3. **For patients with renal outflow obstruction**: Refer to urological services unless urgent treatment is required for conditions such as hyperkalaemia, severe uraemia, acidosis, or fluid overload ([Recommendation 1.5.8](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#risk-assessment-referral-criteria-and-shared-care)).

These criteria ensure that patients receive appropriate specialist care based on their specific CKD-related issues.

----------------------------------------
Query:
How do I manage CKD in someone with diabetes?

Answer:
To manage CKD in someone with diabetes (type 1 or type 2), follow these recommendations:

1. **Pharmacotherapy**: Offer an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) if the patient's albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) is 3 mg/mmol or more. These medications should be titrated to the highest licensed dose that the patient can tolerate ([Recommendation 1.6.6](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#pharmacotherapy)).

2. **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor the patient's kidney function and proteinuria. Adjust the frequency of monitoring based on the underlying cause of CKD, the rate of decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and any changes in treatment ([Rationale rtnl_5_part2](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/rationale-and-impact#frequency-of-monitoring-3)).

3. **Consideration of Finerenone**: For adults with stage 3 and 4 CKD associated with type 2 diabetes and an ACR of 3 mg/mmol or more, consider finerenone as an add-on to optimized standard care ([Recommendation 1.6.9](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#pharmacotherapy)).

These steps help to manage CKD effectively in diabetic patients, aiming to slow disease progression and reduce complications.

----------------------------------------
Query:
How do I monitor CKD progression over time?

Answer:
To monitor CKD progression over time, follow these steps:

1. **Frequency of Monitoring**: Agree on the frequency of monitoring eGFR and ACR with the patient, considering that CKD may not be progressive in many individuals ([Recommendation 1.3.1](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#frequency-of-monitoring)).

2. **Assessing GFR**: Obtain a minimum of three GFR estimations over a period of at least 90 days to identify the rate of progression. If a new finding of reduced GFR occurs, repeat the GFR within two weeks to rule out acute causes of deterioration ([Recommendation 1.3.6](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#frequency-of-monitoring)).

3. **Defining Progression**: Define accelerated progression as:
   - A sustained decrease in GFR of 25% or more and a change in GFR category within 12 months, or
   - A sustained decrease in GFR of 15 ml/min/1.73 m² per year ([Recommendation 1.3.5](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#frequency-of-monitoring)).

4. **Long-term Monitoring Post-Acute Kidney Injury**: For individuals who have experienced acute kidney injury, monitor for the development or progression of CKD for at least three years, even if eGFR has returned to baseline ([Recommendation 1.1.25](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#investigations-for-chronic-kidney-disease)).

By following these guidelines, you can effectively monitor CKD progression and make informed decisions regarding patient management.

Topic 2 — Query 3
----------------------------------------
Query:
How frequently should I repeat eGFR and ACR?

Answer:
The frequency of repeating eGFR and ACR should be individualized based on the patient's characteristics, risk of progression, and whether a change in ACR is likely to lead to a change in management. The following guidelines can be derived from the provided table:

1. **For ACR Monitoring**:
   - **ACR category A1 (normal to mildly increased, less than 3 mg/mmol)**: Repeat 0 to 1 time per year.
   - **ACR category A2 (moderately increased, 3 to 30 mg/mmol)**: Repeat 1 time per year.
   - **ACR category A3 (severely increased, over 30 mg/mmol)**: Repeat 1 or more times per year, depending on the GFR category ([Table 2](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#frequency-of-monitoring)).

2. **For eGFR Monitoring**:
   - The frequency of eGFR testing is also based on the ACR category and the GFR category. For example, in GFR category G3a (mild to moderate reduction), ACR category A3 should be monitored 2 times per year, while ACR category A2 should be monitored 1 time per year ([Table 2](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#frequency-of-monitoring)).

In summary, the monitoring frequency should be tailored to the individual patient, considering their specific ACR and GFR categories.

========================================
Topic 3 — Query 1
----------------------------------------
Query:
Why do we check ACR in CKD?

Answer:
ACR (albumin:creatinine ratio) is checked in CKD for several important reasons:

1. **Monitoring Proteinuria**: ACR is used to quantify proteinuria, which is a key marker of kidney damage. It helps in assessing the severity of kidney impairment and the risk of progression of CKD ([Rationale rtnl_2_part1](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/rationale-and-impact#investigations-for-proteinuria-3)).

2. **Guiding Treatment Decisions**: The measurement of ACR can influence treatment changes, particularly in children and young people with CKD. Research is recommended to understand how ACR compares with PCR (protein:creatinine ratio) in this context ([Rationale rtnl_2_part3](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/rationale-and-impact#investigations-for-proteinuria-3)).

3. **Risk Assessment**: ACR values, along with eGFR, can be integrated into risk assessment tools, such as the 4-variable Kidney Failure Risk Equation, to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of a patient's risk for progression to end-stage renal disease ([Rationale rtnl_6_part7](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/rationale-and-impact#risk-assessment-referral-criteria-and-shared-care-3)).

4. **Individualized Monitoring**: The frequency of ACR monitoring can be tailored based on the patient's specific circumstances, such as the level of ACR and the presence of comorbidities like diabetes, ensuring that those at higher risk are monitored more closely ([Rationale rtnl_6_part9](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/rationale-and-impact#risk-assessment-referral-criteria-and-shared-care-3)).

In summary, checking ACR in CKD is crucial for monitoring kidney damage, guiding treatment, assessing risk, and individualizing patient care.

========================================
Topic 3 — Query 2
----------------------------------------
Query:
What's the reasoning behind monitoring potassium in CKD?

Answer:
The reasoning behind monitoring potassium in CKD is primarily related to the increased risk of kidney disease progression and mortality associated with declining eGFR. As eGFR declines, the risk of complications, including hyperkalemia (elevated potassium levels), increases. This necessitates more frequent monitoring of potassium levels in individuals with CKD, especially those experiencing a rapid decline in eGFR ([Rationale rtnl_5_part2](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/rationale-and-impact#frequency-of-monitoring-3)).

Additionally, the committee recognized the importance of tailoring monitoring frequency to each individual with or at risk of CKD, ensuring that those with significant changes in their kidney function are monitored closely ([Rationale rtnl_5_part2](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/rationale-and-impact#frequency-of-monitoring-3)). This approach helps in preventing complications related to potassium imbalance, which can be critical in managing CKD effectively.

Topic 3 — Query 3
----------------------------------------
Query:
Why is blood pressure control important in CKD?

Answer:
Blood pressure control is important in CKD for several reasons:

1. **Prevention of Kidney Damage**: Maintaining a systolic blood pressure below 130 mmHg and a diastolic pressure below 80 mmHg is crucial to prevent further kidney damage, especially in patients with CKD and proteinuria ([Rationale rtnl_7_part3](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/rationale-and-impact#pharmacotherapy-for-blood-pressure-control)).

2. **Reduction of Complications**: Although intensive blood pressure targets may only marginally reduce the risk of stroke and kidney failure, they can significantly burden patients with polypharmacy and associated risks, such as falls. Therefore, a balanced approach to blood pressure management is necessary ([Rationale rtnl_7_part4](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/rationale-and-impact#pharmacotherapy-for-blood-pressure-control)).

3. **Consistency with Clinical Practice**: The recommendations for blood pressure targets are consistent with broader clinical guidelines for managing hypertension in adults, which helps ensure that patients receive care aligned with established best practices ([Rationale rtnl_7_part2](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/rationale-and-impact#pharmacotherapy-for-blood-pressure-control)).

4. **Impact on Comorbid Conditions**: For individuals with type 2 diabetes, controlling blood pressure with medications such as ARBs and ACE inhibitors has been shown to reduce the risk of end-stage renal disease and heart failure, highlighting the importance of blood pressure management in this population ([Rationale rtnl_8_part4](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/rationale-and-impact#pharmacotherapy-for-proteinuria-and-choice-of-antihypertensive-agent)).

In summary, effective blood pressure control in CKD is essential to prevent further kidney damage, reduce the risk of complications, and align with established clinical guidelines.

----------------------------------------
Query:
Why do we avoid NSAIDs in CKD?

Answer:
NSAIDs are avoided in CKD for the following reasons:

1. **Risk of Progression**: Chronic use of NSAIDs in adults with CKD may be associated with the progression of the disease. This is particularly concerning for patients with a low baseline GFR and those with other risk factors for CKD progression ([Recommendation 1.3.10](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#frequency-of-monitoring)).

2. **Acute Effects on GFR**: The acute use of NSAIDs can lead to a reversible decrease in GFR, which poses a risk to kidney function, especially in individuals with existing kidney impairment ([Recommendation 1.3.10](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#frequency-of-monitoring)).

3. **Monitoring Requirements**: Due to the potential adverse effects of NSAIDs on kidney function, it is recommended to monitor GFR at least annually in individuals taking medications that can adversely affect kidney function, including NSAIDs ([Recommendation 1.1.20](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#investigations-for-chronic-kidney-disease)).

In summary, NSAIDs are avoided in CKD due to their association with disease progression and the risk of acute decreases in GFR.

Answer:
The GFR/ACR risk grid categorizes the risk of adverse outcomes in adults based on their GFR (glomerular filtration rate) and ACR (albumin:creatinine ratio) levels. Here is the grid:

|  | ACR category A1: normal to mildly increased (less than 3 mg/mmol) | ACR category A2: moderately increased (3 to 30 mg/mmol) | ACR category A3: severely increased (over 30 mg/mmol) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GFR category G1: normal and high (90 ml/min/1.73 m² or over) | Low risk (No CKD if there are no other markers of kidney damage) | Moderate risk | High risk |
| GFR category G2: mild reduction related to normal range for a young adult (60 to 89 ml/min/1.73 m²) | Low risk (No CKD if there are no other markers of kidney damage) | Moderate risk | High risk |
| GFR category G3a: mild to moderate reduction (45 to 59 ml/min/1.73 m²) | Moderate risk | High risk | Very high risk |
| GFR category G3b: moderate to severe reduction (30 to 44 ml/min/1.73 m²) | High risk | Very high risk | Very high risk |
| GFR category G4: severe reduction (15 to 29 ml/min/1.73 m²) | Very high risk | Very high risk | Very high risk |
| GFR category G5: kidney failure (under 15 ml/min/1.73 m²) | Very high risk | Very high risk | Very high risk |

This grid helps in assessing the risk of adverse outcomes based on the combination of GFR and ACR categories ([Table 1](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#classification-of-ckd-in-adults)).

Query:
How do I classify CKD using GFR and ACR?

Answer:
To classify CKD using GFR (glomerular filtration rate) and ACR (albumin:creatinine ratio), you can refer to the following categories as outlined in the NICE NG203 guidelines:

1. **GFR Categories**:
   - **G1**: Normal and high (≥ 90 ml/min/1.73 m²)
   - **G2**: Mild reduction (60 to 89 ml/min/1.73 m²)
   - **G3a**: Mild to moderate reduction (45 to 59 ml/min/1.73 m²)
   - **G3b**: Moderate to severe reduction (30 to 44 ml/min/1.73 m²)
   - **G4**: Severe reduction (15 to 29 ml/min/1.73 m²)
   - **G5**: Kidney failure (< 15 ml/min/1.73 m²)

2. **ACR Categories**:
   - **A1**: Normal to mildly increased (< 3 mg/mmol)
   - **A2**: Moderately increased (3 to 30 mg/mmol)
   - **A3**: Severely increased (> 30 mg/mmol)

3. **Risk Classification**:
   The combination of GFR and ACR categories helps determine the risk of adverse outcomes:
   - For example, a patient with GFR category G1 and ACR category A1 is at low risk, while a patient with GFR category G3b and ACR category A3 is at very high risk ([Table 1](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#classification-of-ckd-in-adults)).

In summary, classify CKD by determining the patient's GFR and ACR categories, and use this classification to assess the risk of adverse outcomes ([Recommendation 1.2.1](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#classification-of-ckd-in-adults)).
========================================

Query:
What does ACR actually mean?

Answer:
ACR stands for albumin:creatinine ratio. It is a laboratory measurement used to assess the amount of albumin (a type of protein) in the urine relative to the level of creatinine (a waste product) in the urine. This ratio helps in the detection of proteinuria, which can be an indicator of kidney damage or disease.

In clinical practice, ACR is used to monitor kidney health, particularly in individuals with conditions such as diabetes or hypertension. An ACR of 3 mg/mmol or more is regarded as clinically important proteinuria, and an ACR of 70 mg/mmol or more is a threshold for referral for specialist assessment unless it is known to be caused by diabetes and is already appropriately treated ([Recommendation 1.1.13](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#investigations-for-chronic-kidney-disease), [Recommendation 1.5.5](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#risk-assessment-referral-criteria-and-shared-care)).

Topic 5 — Query 4
----------------------------------------
Query:
When should I worry about declining kidney function?

Answer:
You should be concerned about declining kidney function in the following situations:

1. **Significant Changes in eGFR or Serum Creatinine**: If an adult's estimated GFR (eGFR) changes by 25% or more, or if there is a change in serum creatinine of 30% or more, this warrants investigation into other potential causes of deterioration in kidney function, such as volume depletion or the use of certain medications (e.g., NSAIDs) ([Recommendation 1.6.23](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#pharmacotherapy)).

2. **New Findings of Reduced GFR**: If there is a new finding of reduced GFR, it is recommended to repeat the GFR measurement within 2 weeks to exclude acute causes of deterioration, such as acute kidney injury or the initiation of renin–angiotensin system antagonist therapy ([Recommendation 1.3.6](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#frequency-of-monitoring)).

3. **Increase in Serum Creatinine**: For individuals with an eGFR greater than 90 ml/min/1.73 m², an increase in serum creatinine concentration of more than 20% should be considered significant and indicative of a reduction in kidney function ([Recommendation 1.1.6](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#investigations-for-chronic-kidney-disease)).

4. **Monitoring in High-Risk Patients**: Regular monitoring of GFR is advised at least annually for adults, children, and young people who are taking medications that can adversely affect kidney function, such as calcineurin inhibitors, lithium, or long-term NSAIDs ([Recommendation 1.1.20](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#investigations-for-chronic-kidney-disease)).

In summary, significant changes in eGFR or serum creatinine, new findings of reduced GFR, and specific increases in serum creatinine should prompt further investigation and concern regarding declining kidney function.
========================================

========================================
Topic 5 — Query 5
----------------------------------------
Query:
What's the deal with protein in the urine?

Answer:
Protein in the urine, or proteinuria, is an important clinical marker that can indicate kidney damage or disease. The NICE guidelines recommend measuring proteinuria using the urine albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) in specific groups, including:

- Adults, children, and young people with diabetes (type 1 or type 2).
- Adults with an estimated GFR (eGFR) of less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m².
- Adults with an eGFR of 60 ml/min/1.73 m² or more if there is a strong suspicion of chronic kidney disease (CKD).
- Children and young people without diabetes who have creatinine levels above the upper limit of the age-appropriate reference range ([Recommendation 1.1.14](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#investigations-for-chronic-kidney-disease)).

A confirmed ACR of 3 mg/mmol or more is regarded as clinically important proteinuria, which may necessitate further investigation and management ([Recommendation 1.1.13](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#investigations-for-chronic-kidney-disease)).

For initial detection, urine ACR is preferred over the protein:creatinine ratio (PCR) due to its greater sensitivity for low levels of proteinuria. If the initial ACR is between 3 mg/mmol and 70 mg/mmol, a subsequent early morning sample should be checked to confirm the result. However, if the initial ACR is 70 mg/mmol or more, a repeat sample is not necessary ([Recommendation 1.1.12](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#investigations-for-chronic-kidney-disease)).

In cases where proteinuria is an incidental finding on a reagent strip, further testing for CKD using eGFR and ACR is recommended ([Recommendation 1.1.15](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#investigations-for-chronic-kidney-disease)). 

Overall, the presence of protein in the urine is a significant finding that requires careful evaluation and management to prevent progression of kidney disease.

If the albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) is high but the estimated GFR (eGFR) is normal, you should take the following actions:

1. **Referral for Specialist Assessment**: Refer the patient for specialist assessment if the ACR is 70 mg/mmol or more, unless it is known to be caused by diabetes and is already appropriately treated ([Recommendation 1.5.5](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#risk-assessment-referral-criteria-and-shared-care)).

2. **Monitoring**: If the ACR is above 30 mg/mmol but below 70 mg/mmol, monitor the patient in line with the recommendations. Consider discussing the case with a nephrologist if there is a decline in eGFR or if the ACR increases ([Recommendation 1.6.7](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#pharmacotherapy)).

3. **Consider Pharmacotherapy**: For adults with CKD but without diabetes, if the ACR is 70 mg/mmol or more, offer an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) or an ACE inhibitor, titrated to the highest tolerated dose ([Recommendation 1.6.7](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#pharmacotherapy)).

In summary, high ACR with normal eGFR necessitates referral for specialist assessment, careful monitoring, and potential pharmacotherapy depending on the specific ACR levels.

Query:
How do I interpret fluctuating eGFR results?

Answer:
To interpret fluctuating estimated GFR (eGFR) results, consider the following recommendations:

1. **Confirm Low eGFR**: If an eGFR result is less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m² in an adult who has not been previously tested, it is important to confirm this result by repeating the test within 2 weeks. This helps account for biological and analytical variability in serum creatinine, which can affect eGFR readings ([Recommendation 1.1.8](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#investigations-for-chronic-kidney-disease)).

2. **Caution with Higher eGFR Values**: For eGFR values of 60 ml/min/1.73 m² or more, interpret these results with caution. The accuracy of eGFR estimates decreases as the true GFR increases, which can lead to misinterpretation of kidney function ([Recommendation 1.1.7](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#investigations-for-chronic-kidney-disease)).

3. **Monitoring Frequency**: If there is a noticeable decline in eGFR, the risk of kidney disease progression and mortality increases. Therefore, any person presenting with an increase in eGFR decline should be monitored more frequently ([Rationale rtnl_5_part2](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/rationale-and-impact#frequency-of-monitoring-3)).

In summary, when interpreting fluctuating eGFR results, confirm low values with repeat testing, be cautious with higher values due to potential inaccuracies, and increase monitoring frequency if there is a decline in eGFR.

   - Diabetes
   - Hypertension
   - Previous episodes of acute kidney injury
   - Cardiovascular disease
   - Structural renal tract disease or recurrent renal calculi
   - Family history of end-stage renal disease or hereditary kidney disease
   - Incidental detection of haematuria or proteinuria ([Recommendation 1.1.21](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#investigations-for-chronic-kidney-disease)).

2. **Confirming CKD**: If an eGFR result is less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m², confirm this by repeating the test within 2 weeks to account for biological and analytical variability ([Recommendation 1.1.8](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#investigations-for-chronic-kidney-disease)).

3. **Identifying Proteinuria**: A confirmed ACR of 3 mg/mmol or more is regarded as clinically important proteinuria, which is a marker of kidney damage ([Recommendation 1.1.13](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#investigations-for-chronic-kidney-disease)).

### Classification of CKD Severity

CKD is classified based on GFR and ACR categories, which can help assess the risk of adverse outcomes. The classification is as follows:

- **GFR Category G1 (90 ml/min/1.73 m² or over)**:
  - ACR A1 (less than 3 mg/mmol): Low risk, no CKD if no other markers of kidney damage.
  - ACR A2 (3 to 30 mg/mmol): Moderate risk.
  - ACR A3 (over 30 mg/mmol): High risk.

- **GFR Category G2 (60 to 89 ml/min/1.73 m²)**:
  - ACR A1: Low risk, no CKD if no other markers of kidney damage.
  - ACR A2: Moderate risk.
  - ACR A3: High risk.

- **GFR Category G3a (45 to 59 ml/min/1.73 m²)**:
  - ACR A1: Moderate risk.
  - ACR A2: High risk.
  - ACR A3: Very high risk.

- **GFR Category G3b (30 to 44 ml/min/1.73 m²)**:
  - ACR A1: High risk.
  - ACR A2: Very high risk.
  - ACR A3: Very high risk.

- **GFR Category G4 (15 to 29 ml/min/1.73 m²)**:
  - ACR A1: Very high risk.
  - ACR A2: Very high risk.
  - ACR A3: Very high risk.

- **GFR Category G5 (under 15 ml/min/1.73 m²)**:
  - ACR A1: Very high risk.
  - ACR A2: Very high risk.
  - ACR A3: Very high risk ([Table 1](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#classification-of-ckd-in-adults)).

This classification helps in determining the severity of CKD and guiding management decisions.

Query:
How do I manage anaemia in CKD?

Answer:
To manage anaemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD), the following recommendations should be followed:

1. **Patient Education**: Offer culturally and age-appropriate patient education programmes to all individuals diagnosed with anaemia of CKD. These programmes should cover practical information about management, knowledge of symptoms and treatment phases, professional support, lifestyle adaptations, and coping with chronic disease ([Recommendation 1.8.20](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#managing-anaemia)).

2. **Designated Contact Person**: Ensure that patients have access to a designated contact person or team responsible for their anaemia management. This person should be skilled in monitoring and managing anaemia, providing information and support, coordinating care between primary and secondary services, and prescribing relevant medications ([Recommendation 1.9.5](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#assessing-and-optimising-erythropoiesis-in-people-with-anaemia)).

3. **Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agents (ESA)**: If a trial of ESA therapy is initiated, assess its effectiveness after an agreed interval. Discuss with the patient and their family whether to continue ESA therapy based on the assessment results ([Recommendation 1.8.6](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#managing-anaemia)).

4. **Blood Transfusions**: Avoid blood transfusions if possible in patients with anaemia of CKD who are candidates for kidney transplantation ([Recommendation 1.9.2](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#assessing-and-optimising-erythropoiesis-in-people-with-anaemia)).

5. **Investigating Other Causes of Anaemia**: In adults, children, and young people with anaemia, if the eGFR is above 60 ml/min/1.73 m², investigate other causes of anaemia, as it is unlikely to be due to CKD. If the eGFR is between 30 and 60 ml/min/1.73 m², use clinical judgement to determine the extent of investigation needed ([Recommendation 1.7.2](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#diagnosing-and-assessing-anaemia)).

These steps are essential for effectively managing anaemia in patients with CKD, ensuring they receive comprehensive care and support.

Topic 10 — Query 1
----------------------------------------
Query:
How do I classify CKD and determine the patient's risk category?

Answer:
To classify chronic kidney disease (CKD) and determine the patient's risk category, you should assess both the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and the albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR). The classification is based on the following categories:

1. **GFR Categories**:
   - **G1**: Normal and high (90 ml/min/1.73 m² or over)
   - **G2**: Mild reduction (60 to 89 ml/min/1.73 m²)
   - **G3a**: Mild to moderate reduction (45 to 59 ml/min/1.73 m²)
   - **G3b**: Moderate to severe reduction (30 to 44 ml/min/1.73 m²)
   - **G4**: Severe reduction (15 to 29 ml/min/1.73 m²)
   - **G5**: Kidney failure (under 15 ml/min/1.73 m²)

2. **ACR Categories**:
   - **A1**: Normal to mildly increased (less than 3 mg/mmol)
   - **A2**: Moderately increased (3 to 30 mg/mmol)
   - **A3**: Severely increased (over 30 mg/mmol)

3. **Risk Classification**:
   Using the GFR and ACR categories, you can determine the risk of adverse outcomes as follows:

   - **GFR category G1**:
     - ACR A1: Low risk (no CKD if no other markers of kidney damage)
     - ACR A2: Moderate risk
     - ACR A3: High risk
   - **GFR category G2**:
     - ACR A1: Low risk (no CKD if no other markers of kidney damage)
     - ACR A2: Moderate risk
     - ACR A3: High risk
   - **GFR category G3a**:
     - ACR A1: Moderate risk
     - ACR A2: High risk
     - ACR A3: Very high risk
   - **GFR category G3b**:
     - ACR A1: High risk
     - ACR A2: Very high risk
     - ACR A3: Very high risk
   - **GFR category G4**:
     - ACR A1: Very high risk
     - ACR A2: Very high risk
     - ACR A3: Very high risk
   - **GFR category G5**:
     - ACR A1: Very high risk
     - ACR A2: Very high risk
     - ACR A3: Very high risk

By combining the GFR and ACR categories, you can classify the CKD stage and assess the patient's risk for adverse outcomes ([Table 1](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#classification-of-ckd-in-adults)).
========================================

========================================
Topic 10 — Query 2
----------------------------------------
Query:
What investigations should I order for suspected CKD and why?

Answer:
For suspected chronic kidney disease (CKD), the NICE NG203 guidelines recommend the following investigations:

1. **Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR)**: This test is essential for assessing kidney function. It helps classify the stage of CKD based on the level of kidney function ([Recommendation 1.1.23](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#investigations-for-chronic-kidney-disease)).

2. **Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR)**: This test is used to assess for proteinuria, which is a marker of kidney damage. Measuring ACR is particularly important in individuals with risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension, or a history of acute kidney injury ([Recommendation 1.1.14](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#investigations-for-chronic-kidney-disease)).

3. **Additional Testing for Specific Risk Groups**: 
   - In children and young people with risk factors such as low birth weight, diabetes, hypertension, cardiac disease, or a family history of kidney disease, testing for CKD using eGFR and ACR is recommended ([Recommendation 1.1.23](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#investigations-for-chronic-kidney-disease)).
   - For those with a previous episode of acute kidney injury or a solitary functioning kidney, testing is also advised ([Recommendation 1.1.22](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#investigations-for-chronic-kidney-disease)).

These investigations are crucial for confirming the diagnosis of CKD, assessing its severity, and guiding further management.
========================================

========================================
Topic 10 — Query 3
----------------------------------------
Query:
How should I monitor CKD progression and what evidence supports this?

Answer:
To monitor CKD progression, the NICE NG203 guidelines recommend individualizing the frequency of monitoring based on the patient's characteristics and risks. This includes assessing the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) regularly.

1. **Frequency of Monitoring**: The frequency of monitoring should be tailored to each individual, taking into account their specific risk factors and the rate of eGFR decline. It is noted that with a decline in eGFR, the risk of kidney disease progression and mortality increases, and this risk escalates with the rate of eGFR decline. Therefore, individuals presenting with an increased rate of eGFR decline should be monitored more frequently ([Rationale rtnl_5_part2](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/rationale-and-impact#frequency-of-monitoring-3)).

2. **Clinical Practice Evidence**: The committee's agreement on the monitoring recommendations is based on clinical practice observations and the evidence that shows a correlation between eGFR decline and increased risk of adverse outcomes ([Rationale rtnl_5_part2](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/rationale-and-impact#frequency-of-monitoring-3)).

3. **Individualized Approach**: The guidelines emphasize that monitoring should be agreed upon with each person with or at risk of CKD, reflecting the need for a personalized approach to care ([Rationale rtnl_5_part2](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/rationale-and-impact#frequency-of-monitoring-3)).

In summary, monitoring CKD progression involves regular assessment of eGFR and ACR, with the frequency of these assessments tailored to the individual patient's risk profile and clinical status.

----------------------------------------
Query:
How do I assess and manage anaemia in CKD, including iron therapy?

Answer:
To assess and manage anaemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD), follow these guidelines from the NICE NG203 recommendations:

1. **Assessment of Anaemia**:
   - **Diagnostic Tests**: Do not routinely measure erythropoietin levels for the diagnosis or management of anaemia in people with anaemia of CKD ([Recommendation 1.7.5](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#diagnosing-and-assessing-anaemia)).
   - **eGFR Considerations**: If the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is above 60 ml/min/1.73 m², investigate other causes of anaemia, as it is unlikely to be caused by CKD. If eGFR is between 30 and 60 ml/min/1.73 m², consider other causes but recognize that anaemia may be due to CKD. If eGFR is below 30 ml/min/1.73 m², consider other causes but note that anaemia is often caused by CKD ([Recommendation 1.7.2](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#diagnosing-and-assessing-anaemia)).

2. **Management of Anaemia**:
   - **Iron Therapy**: Assess iron status to determine the need for iron supplementation. If iron deficiency is present, iron therapy should be initiated. The guidelines do not specify the exact parameters for iron status assessment, but typically serum ferritin and transferrin saturation are evaluated.
   - **Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agents (ESAs)**: If the patient has sufficient iron, discuss the pros and cons of a trial of ESA therapy. If a trial is conducted, assess its effectiveness after an agreed interval and decide whether to continue based on the patient's response ([Recommendation 1.8.3](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#managing-anaemia) and [Recommendation 1.8.6](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#managing-anaemia)).
   - **Hypoxia-Inducible Factor Prolyl-Hydroxylase Inhibitors**: For symptomatic anaemia, Roxadustat is recommended for adults with stage 3 to 5 CKD who are not on dialysis and do not have iron deficiency. Vadadustat is recommended for treating symptomatic anaemia in adults on maintenance dialysis ([Recommendation 1.8.9](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#managing-anaemia) and [Recommendation 1.8.8](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#managing-anaemia)).

3. **Patient Education**: Offer culturally and age-appropriate education programs to patients and their families about managing anaemia, including information on symptoms, iron management, and lifestyle adaptations ([Recommendation 1.8.20](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#managing-anaemia)).

By following these recommendations, you can effectively assess and manage anaemia in patients with CKD, including appropriate use of iron therapy and ESAs.

2. **Visible or Persistent Invisible Haematuria**: To investigate the cause of blood in the urine.
3. **Symptoms of Urinary Tract Obstruction**: To evaluate for any obstructions in the urinary tract.
4. **Family History of Polycystic Kidney Disease**: For individuals older than 20 years with such a family history.
5. **GFR Less Than 30 ml/min/1.73 m²**: For patients classified as GFR category G4 or G5.
6. **Need for Renal Biopsy**: If a nephrologist considers it necessary ([Recommendation 1.2.5](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#classification-of-ckd-in-adults)).

The rationale for these indications is to identify underlying structural abnormalities, assess the cause of CKD, and guide further management, especially in cases of rapid progression or concerning symptoms.
