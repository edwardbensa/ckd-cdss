Topic 1 — Query 1

Query:
How do I diagnose CKD and confirm its severity?

Answer:
To diagnose chronic kidney disease (CKD), you should test for kidney function using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) based on serum creatinine and albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR). Testing is recommended for individuals with specific risk factors, including:

- Adults with diabetes, hypertension, previous acute kidney injury, cardiovascular disease, structural renal tract disease, multisystem diseases with potential kidney involvement, gout, or a family history of end-stage renal disease.
- Children and young people with low birth weight, diabetes, hypertension, cardiac disease, structural renal tract disease, multisystem diseases, or a family history of hereditary kidney disease ([Recommendation 1.1.21](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#investigations-for-chronic-kidney-disease), [Recommendation 1.1.23](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#investigations-for-chronic-kidney-disease)).

To confirm a diagnosis of CKD, if the eGFR is less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m², you should repeat the test within 2 weeks to account for biological and analytical variability ([Recommendation 1.1.6](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#investigations-for-chronic-kidney-disease), [Recommendation 1.1.8](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#investigations-for-chronic-kidney-disease)).

To assess the severity of CKD, you can classify it based on the eGFR and ACR categories:

- **GFR category G1 (≥90 ml/min/1.73 m²)**: No CKD if no other markers of kidney damage; low risk.
- **GFR category G2 (60-89 ml/min/1.73 m²)**: No CKD if no other markers; low risk.
- **GFR category G3a (45-59 ml/min/1.73 m²)**: Moderate risk.
- **GFR category G3b (30-44 ml/min/1.73 m²)**: High risk.
- **GFR category G4 (15-29 ml/min/1.73 m²)**: Very high risk.
- **GFR category G5 (<15 ml/min/1.73 m²)**: Very high risk ([Table 1](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#classification-of-ckd-in-adults)).

This classification helps in determining the risk of adverse outcomes associated with CKD and guides management decisions.


Topic 1 — Query 2

Query:
How do I classify CKD using GFR and ACR, and determine the patient's risk category?

Answer:
To classify chronic kidney disease (CKD) using the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and the albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), you can refer to the following categories:

1. **GFR Categories**:
   - **G1**: Normal and high (≥90 ml/min/1.73 m²)
   - **G2**: Mild reduction (60-89 ml/min/1.73 m²)
   - **G3a**: Mild to moderate reduction (45-59 ml/min/1.73 m²)
   - **G3b**: Moderate to severe reduction (30-44 ml/min/1.73 m²)
   - **G4**: Severe reduction (15-29 ml/min/1.73 m²)
   - **G5**: Kidney failure (<15 ml/min/1.73 m²)

2. **ACR Categories**:
   - **A1**: Normal to mildly increased (less than 3 mg/mmol)
   - **A2**: Moderately increased (3 to 30 mg/mmol)
   - **A3**: Severely increased (over 30 mg/mmol)

Using these categories, you can determine the patient's risk of adverse outcomes by combining the GFR and ACR results. The risk categories are as follows:

- **G1 with ACR A1**: Low risk; no CKD if there are no other markers of kidney damage.
- **G1 with ACR A2**: Moderate risk.
- **G1 with ACR A3**: High risk.
- **G2 with ACR A1**: Low risk; no CKD if there are no other markers of kidney damage.
- **G2 with ACR A2**: Moderate risk.
- **G2 with ACR A3**: High risk.
- **G3a with ACR A1**: Moderate risk.
- **G3a with ACR A2**: High risk.
- **G3a with ACR A3**: Very high risk.
- **G3b with ACR A1**: High risk.
- **G3b with ACR A2**: Very high risk.
- **G3b with ACR A3**: Very high risk.
- **G4 with any ACR category**: Very high risk.
- **G5 with any ACR category**: Very high risk ([Table 1](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#classification-of-ckd-in-adults)).

This classification helps in assessing the severity of CKD and guiding management decisions based on the associated risks.


Topic 1 — Query 3

Query:
3.	What investigations should I order for suspected CKD and why?

Answer:
For suspected chronic kidney disease (CKD), you should order the following investigations:

1. **Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR)**: This test is essential for assessing kidney function. It helps in diagnosing CKD and determining its severity based on the level of kidney function ([Recommendation 1.1.23](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#investigations-for-chronic-kidney-disease)).

2. **Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR)**: This test measures proteinuria, which is a marker of kidney damage. It should be performed alongside eGFR in individuals with risk factors for CKD, such as diabetes, hypertension, or a family history of kidney disease ([Recommendation 1.1.23](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#investigations-for-chronic-kidney-disease)).

3. **Urine ACR Measurement**: Specifically, measure proteinuria using urine ACR in adults, children, and young people with diabetes, those with an eGFR of less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m², or those with a strong suspicion of CKD even if their eGFR is 60 ml/min/1.73 m² or more ([Recommendation 1.1.14](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#investigations-for-chronic-kidney-disease)).

These investigations are crucial because they help confirm the diagnosis of CKD by identifying markers of kidney damage and assessing kidney function, which is necessary for appropriate management and treatment decisions.


Topic 1 — Query 4

Query:
4.	What does ACR mean, and why is it important in CKD?

Answer:
ACR stands for Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio. It is a test used to measure the amount of albumin (a type of protein) in the urine relative to the level of creatinine, which is a waste product from muscle metabolism. The ACR is important in chronic kidney disease (CKD) for several reasons:

1. **Marker of Kidney Damage**: An increased ACR indicates the presence of proteinuria, which is a sign of kidney damage. Monitoring ACR helps in the early detection of CKD and the assessment of its severity ([Recommendation 1.1.14](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#investigations-for-chronic-kidney-disease)).

2. **Risk Assessment**: ACR is used in conjunction with eGFR to classify CKD and assess the risk of adverse outcomes. Higher ACR values are associated with increased risks of progression to end-stage kidney disease and cardiovascular events ([Recommendation 1.2.1](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#classification-of-ckd-in-adults)).

3. **Guiding Treatment**: The ACR results can influence management decisions, such as the initiation of antihypertensive therapy (e.g., ACE inhibitors or ARBs) in patients with CKD, especially when ACR is 70 mg/mmol or more ([Recommendation 1.6.7](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#pharmacotherapy)).

In summary, ACR is a crucial test in the diagnosis, classification, and management of CKD, providing valuable information about kidney health and guiding treatment strategies.


Topic 1 — Query 5

Query:
5.	Why do we check for protein in the urine, and what does it indicate?

Answer:
We check for protein in the urine, specifically through the measurement of albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), because it serves as a crucial marker of kidney damage. The presence of proteinuria indicates that the kidneys are not functioning properly, as healthy kidneys typically prevent significant amounts of protein from entering the urine.

The key reasons for checking protein in the urine include:

1. **Detection of Kidney Damage**: Proteinuria is a sign of kidney damage and can indicate the presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD). A confirmed ACR of 3 mg/mmol or more is regarded as clinically important proteinuria, which necessitates further investigation and management ([Recommendation 1.1.13](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#investigations-for-chronic-kidney-disease)).

2. **Risk Assessment**: The level of protein in the urine helps assess the risk of progression to more severe stages of CKD and associated complications. Higher levels of proteinuria are linked to worse kidney outcomes and increased cardiovascular risk ([Recommendation 1.1.14](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#investigations-for-chronic-kidney-disease)).

3. **Guiding Treatment Decisions**: The presence and level of proteinuria can influence treatment strategies, such as the initiation of specific antihypertensive therapies (e.g., ACE inhibitors) to protect kidney function in patients with CKD ([Rationale rtnl_8_part2](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/rationale-and-impact#pharmacotherapy-for-proteinuria-and-choice-of-antihypertensive-agent)).

In summary, checking for protein in the urine is vital for diagnosing kidney damage, assessing risk, and guiding appropriate management in patients suspected of having CKD.


Topic 2 — Query 1

Query:
How do I monitor CKD progression over time?

Answer:
To monitor chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression over time, you should follow these recommendations:

1. **Regular Monitoring of eGFR and ACR**: Monitor the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) regularly. The frequency of monitoring should be agreed upon with the patient, considering that CKD may not be progressive in many individuals ([Recommendation 1.3.1](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#frequency-of-monitoring)).

2. **Assessing Progression**: To define CKD progression, obtain a minimum of three eGFR estimations over a period of not less than 90 days. If there is a new finding of reduced eGFR, repeat the test within 2 weeks to rule out acute causes of deterioration ([Recommendation 1.3.6](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#frequency-of-monitoring)).

3. **Identifying Accelerated Progression**: Define accelerated progression as:
   - A sustained decrease in eGFR of 25% or more and a change in eGFR category within 12 months, or
   - A sustained decrease in eGFR of 15 ml/min/1.73 m² per year ([Recommendation 1.3.5](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#frequency-of-monitoring)).

4. **Long-term Monitoring After Acute Kidney Injury**: For individuals who have experienced acute kidney injury, monitor for the development or progression of CKD for at least 3 years, even if the eGFR has returned to baseline ([Recommendation 1.1.25](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#investigations-for-chronic-kidney-disease)).

5. **Consider Risk Factors**: Be aware of risk factors associated with CKD progression, such as cardiovascular disease, proteinuria, previous acute kidney injury, hypertension, diabetes, and chronic use of NSAIDs. Work with patients to optimize their health regarding these factors ([Recommendation 1.3.9](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#frequency-of-monitoring)).

By following these guidelines, you can effectively monitor CKD progression and make informed decisions regarding patient management.

Answer:



Topic 2 — Query 4

Query:
How do I identify rapid CKD progression?

Answer:
To identify rapid chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression, you can define it as follows:

1. **Sustained Decrease in GFR**: A sustained decrease in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 25% or more, along with a change in GFR category, within a 12-month period.
   
2. **Annual Decline in GFR**: A sustained decrease in GFR of 15 ml/min/1.73 m² or more per year ([Recommendation 1.3.5](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#frequency-of-monitoring), [Recommendation 1.3.6](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#frequency-of-monitoring)).

To monitor for these changes, it is recommended to obtain a minimum of three GFR estimations over a period of not less than 90 days. If there is a new finding of reduced GFR, it is important to repeat the GFR within 2 weeks to exclude acute causes of deterioration ([Recommendation 1.3.6](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#frequency-of-monitoring)).

By applying these criteria, you can effectively identify rapid progression of CKD and take appropriate management steps.


Topic 2 — Query 5

Query:
How do I interpret fluctuating eGFR results?

Answer:
When interpreting fluctuating estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) results, consider the following key points:

1. **Caution with eGFR Values**: eGFR values of 60 ml/min/1.73 m² or more should be interpreted with caution, as estimates of GFR become less accurate as the true GFR increases ([Recommendation 1.1.7](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#investigations-for-chronic-kidney-disease)).

2. **Confirming Low eGFR**: If an eGFR result is less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m², it is important to confirm this finding by repeating the test within 2 weeks. This helps account for biological and analytical variability in serum creatinine, which can be around ±5% ([Recommendation 1.1.8](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#investigations-for-chronic-kidney-disease)).

3. **Impact of Muscle Mass**: Be cautious when interpreting eGFR in adults with extremes of muscle mass (e.g., bodybuilders, individuals with amputations, or muscle wasting disorders). Reduced muscle mass may lead to an overestimation of GFR, while increased muscle mass may lead to an underestimation ([Recommendation 1.1.3](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#investigations-for-chronic-kidney-disease)).

4. **Significant Changes in eGFR**: If eGFR is greater than 90 ml/min/1.73 m², an increase in serum creatinine concentration of more than 20% can indicate a significant reduction in kidney function ([Recommendation 1.1.6](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#investigations-for-chronic-kidney-disease)).

5. **Monitoring Frequency**: Fluctuating eGFR results may necessitate more frequent monitoring, especially if there is a decline in eGFR, as this is associated with an increased risk of kidney disease progression and mortality ([Rationale rtnl_5_part2](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/rationale-and-impact#frequency-of-monitoring-3)).

By applying these considerations, you can more accurately interpret fluctuating eGFR results and make informed clinical decisions.

5. **Risk of Renal Replacement Therapy**: If there is a 5-year risk of needing renal replacement therapy greater than 5%, as measured using the 4-variable Kidney Failure Risk Equation ([Recommendation 1.5.5](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#risk-assessment-referral-criteria-and-shared-care)).

6. **Rare or Genetic Causes of CKD**: If there are known or suspected rare or genetic causes of CKD ([Recommendation 1.5.5](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#risk-assessment-referral-criteria-and-shared-care)).

7. **Renal Outflow Obstruction**: Refer patients with CKD and renal outflow obstruction to urological services unless urgent treatment is needed ([Recommendation 1.5.8](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#risk-assessment-referral-criteria-and-shared-care)).

By adhering to these criteria, you can ensure appropriate referral for CKD patients who may require specialist assessment and management.


Topic 3 — Query 2

Query:
What should I do if ACR is high but eGFR is normal?

Answer:
If the albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) is high but the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is normal, you should take the following actions:

1. **Referral for Specialist Assessment**: Refer the patient for nephrology assessment if the ACR is 70 mg/mmol or more, unless it is known to be caused by diabetes and is already appropriately treated ([Recommendation 1.5.5](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#risk-assessment-referral-criteria-and-shared-care)).

2. **Monitoring**: If the ACR is above 30 mg/mmol but below 70 mg/mmol, monitor the patient in line with the recommendations for frequency of monitoring. Consider discussing the case with a nephrologist if there is a decline in eGFR or an increase in ACR ([Recommendation 1.6.7](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#pharmacotherapy)).

3. **Pharmacotherapy Consideration**: For adults with CKD but without diabetes and an ACR of 70 mg/mmol or more, consider offering an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) or an ACE inhibitor, titrated to the highest tolerated dose ([Recommendation 1.6.7](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#pharmacotherapy)).

By following these steps, you can effectively manage a patient with high ACR and normal eGFR, ensuring appropriate monitoring and intervention as needed.

To assess chronic kidney disease (CKD) risk using the GFR/ACR risk grid, follow these steps:

1. **Determine GFR and ACR Categories**: First, classify the patient's kidney function based on their estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR). The GFR categories are:
   - G1: Normal and high (≥90 ml/min/1.73 m²)
   - G2: Mild reduction (60-89 ml/min/1.73 m²)
   - G3a: Mild to moderate reduction (45-59 ml/min/1.73 m²)
   - G3b: Moderate to severe reduction (30-44 ml/min/1.73 m²)
   - G4: Severe reduction (15-29 ml/min/1.73 m²)
   - G5: Kidney failure (<15 ml/min/1.73 m²)

   The ACR categories are:
   - A1: Normal to mildly increased (<3 mg/mmol)
   - A2: Moderately increased (3-30 mg/mmol)
   - A3: Severely increased (>30 mg/mmol) ([Table 1](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#classification-of-ckd-in-adults)).

2. **Use the Risk Grid**: Cross-reference the GFR and ACR categories on the risk grid to determine the patient's risk of adverse outcomes, such as CKD progression, acute kidney injury, all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular events. The risk levels are categorized as follows:
   - **Low Risk**: GFR category G1 or G2 with ACR category A1.
   - **Moderate Risk**: GFR category G1 or G2 with ACR category A2; GFR category G3a with ACR category A1.
   - **High Risk**: GFR category G3a with ACR category A2; GFR category G3b with ACR category A1; GFR category G1 or G2 with ACR category A3.
   - **Very High Risk**: GFR category G3b with ACR category A2; GFR category G3a or G3b with ACR category A3; GFR category G4 or G5 with any ACR category ([Table 1](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#classification-of-ckd-in-adults)).

3. **Discuss Findings with the Patient**: After determining the risk level, discuss the implications with the patient, including potential management strategies and the need for monitoring or referral to a specialist ([Recommendation 1.1.4](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#classification-of-ckd-in-adults)).

By following these steps, you can effectively use the GFR/ACR risk grid to assess CKD risk and guide patient management.

Topic 5 — Query 1

Query:
How do I assess and manage anaemia in CKD, including iron therapy?

Answer:
To assess and manage anaemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD), including iron therapy, follow these recommendations:

1. **Assessment of Iron Deficiency**:
   - Do not request transferrin saturation or serum ferritin measurement alone to assess iron deficiency status in people with anaemia of CKD ([Recommendation 1.7.4](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#diagnosing-and-assessing-anaemia)).

2. **Iron Therapy for Iron Deficiency**:
   - **For patients not on ESA therapy**: Offer iron therapy to adults, children, and young people with anaemia of CKD who are iron deficient. For those not on haemodialysis, consider a trial of oral iron before intravenous iron therapy. If they are intolerant of oral iron or target hemoglobin (Hb) levels are not reached within 3 months, offer intravenous iron therapy. For patients on haemodialysis, offer intravenous iron therapy ([Recommendation 1.9.21](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#assessing-and-optimising-erythropoiesis-in-people-with-anaemia)).

   - **For patients receiving ESA therapy**: Offer iron therapy to those who are iron deficient. For adults and young people, intravenous iron therapy is recommended. For children on haemodialysis, intravenous iron is also recommended, while for those not on haemodialysis, consider oral iron first, switching to intravenous if intolerant or if target Hb levels are not achieved ([Recommendation 1.9.23](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#assessing-and-optimising-erythropoiesis-in-people-with-anaemia)).

3. **Correcting Iron Deficiency**:
   - Aim to achieve a percentage of hypochromic red blood cells less than 6% and a reticulocyte Hb count above 29 pg, unless ferritin is greater than 800 micrograms/litre. If these tests are not available, maintain transferrin saturation greater than 20% and serum ferritin level greater than 100 micrograms/litre ([Recommendation 1.9.17](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#assessing-and-optimising-erythropoiesis-in-people-with-anaemia)).

4. **Monitoring Iron Status**:
   - Do not check iron levels earlier than 1 week after administering intravenous iron ([Recommendation 1.10.1](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#monitoring-anaemia-treatment)).

5. **Maintenance Iron Therapy**:
   - Once iron deficiency is corrected, offer maintenance iron to those receiving ESAs to maintain appropriate iron levels. The dosing regimen will depend on the modality of treatment, with those on haemodialysis requiring approximately 50 to 60 mg of intravenous iron per week ([Recommendation 1.9.19](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#assessing-and-optimising-erythropoiesis-in-people-with-anaemia)).

By following these guidelines, you can effectively assess and manage anaemia in CKD patients, ensuring appropriate iron therapy is provided based on their specific needs and treatment status.


Topic 5 — Query 2

Query:
How do I optimise erythropoiesis in CKD patients?

Answer:
The context provided does not contain specific recommendations or rationales for optimizing erythropoiesis in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed answer based solely on the NICE NG203 guideline content. If you have further details or another question, please let me know!


Topic 5 — Query 3

Query:
When is renal ultrasound indicated, and what's the rationale behind it?

Answer:
Renal ultrasound is indicated in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) under the following circumstances:

1. **Accelerated progression of CKD**.
2. **Visible or persistent invisible haematuria**.
3. **Symptoms of urinary tract obstruction**.
4. **Family history of polycystic kidney disease** and the patient is older than 20.
5. **GFR of less than 30 ml/min/1.73 m²** (GFR category G4 or G5).
6. **Consideration for a renal biopsy** by a nephrologist ([Recommendation 1.2.5](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#classification-of-ckd-in-adults)).

The context does not provide a specific rationale for these indications. Therefore, I cannot elaborate on the reasoning behind the recommendations based solely on the NICE NG203 guideline content. If you have further details or another question, please let me know!


Topic 5 — Query 4

Query:
My patient has CKD stage 3b with rising ACR. What should I do next?

Answer:
For a patient with CKD stage 3b and a rising albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), consider the following recommendations:

1. **Pharmacotherapy with Finerenone**: If the patient has type 2 diabetes and an ACR of 3 mg/mmol or more, finerenone is recommended as an option in addition to optimized standard care. This medication can help manage the progression of CKD associated with diabetes ([Recommendation 1.6.9](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#pharmacotherapy)).

2. **Blood Pressure Management**: Although the specific blood pressure target for adults with CKD stage 3b is not detailed in the provided context, it is important to monitor and manage blood pressure effectively, particularly if the ACR is rising. For children and young people with CKD and an ACR of 70 mg/mol or more, the target is to maintain clinic systolic blood pressure below the 50th percentile for height ([Recommendation 1.6.3](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng203/chapter/recommendations#pharmacotherapy)).

In summary, initiate treatment with finerenone if the patient meets the criteria, and ensure appropriate blood pressure management. Regular monitoring of kidney function and ACR is also essential.
